Name of Student: Lindsey Baker

Name of Project: Trip Planner(?)

Project’s Purpose or Goal: a place to gather all information and resources for your next trip or vacation

List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:

Add and Store travel basic information such as flights, arrival and departure dates, and accommodations (user manually inputs) 
Share your travel details with others
Return basic information about your destination (basic phrases in language of the country you are visiting, currency exchange rate
What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.

React/Redux
AWS and AWS RDS 
Material UI 
Flight Search API (https://rapidapi.com/skyscanner/api/skyscanner-flight-search)
Currency Converter https://rapidapi.com/djinn/api/currency-convert
If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.

What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require? 

(Combining these two questions so that I can list additional features next to resource)

For features requiring a database, I am going to attempt to use AWS RDS, with Firebase as a backup

Add, store and share itineraries to your trip (user manually inputs information)
Create packing lists and be able to mark items as done
Store packing lists for future use
Set reminder for after travel date has past to review packing list to mark things as useful, unused or add things you wish you packed,  list these items when user goes to add additional packing lists
User stats for countries, cities traveled to, total days traveled
Weather forecast for your destination on your travel dates https://rapidapi.com/Weather2020/api/weather
Find your flight terminal https://rapidapi.com/flightlookup/api/terminal-information-uri-method
List requirements for your destination, be able to check off completed requirements https://rapidapi.com/hakr/api/visa-list
Suggest places to visit https://rapidapi.com/Fizplaces/api/fiz-places
Find and compare flight details and pricing https://rapidapi.com/skyscanner/api/skyscanner-flight-search
Find transportation https://skedgo.com/tripgo-api/ or possible Lyft and Uber API integration
Is there anything else you’d like your instructor to know? 

I am going to try to keep this incredibly simple to begin with, this week I am going to explore AWS options as they do have a React front end/C# back end that I would love to use. However, I am finding their documentation difficult to understand. If I cannot deploy a sample application to AWS by this weekend I am going to switch focus to using Firebase to deploy and as my database. 

My goal is to keep it incredibly simple to start, styling will be very minimalistic using many built material functions. Realistically, my MVP is my first bullet point, optimized for mobile view and deployed to AWS. If (hopefully when!) I reach MVP, I have plenty of resources and areas to continue to develop this.
