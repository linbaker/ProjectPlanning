https://github.com/linbaker/Trip-Planning/commits/master

Timeline of Planning Day 7/19
8:30: Whiteboarding app design to break into components
9:00: White Board Splash Page components
9:30: Add single Trip compontent reduced down to only for MVP features
10:00: Building out component tree
10:30: Sketch out individual login and sign up design. Research into user authentication to see how component tree should be structured
11:00: Returning to whiteboarding to draw boxes around each component, deciding on component hierarchy 
11:30-onward: Researching mapping out React components to confirm I'm doing it right, restructuring component tree
12:00: Moved to online diagraming of components as I ran out of room on paper/whiteboard. Researching and listing all resources to go into components so that I can create a realistic timeline of how long it will take to build my app and make sure my MVP is not to large. 
12:30: Finished Online component map
1:00ish: Created static version repo
2:00: Spending the rest of the day on research on how I am going to be building my app
2:30: OAuth research and collecting resources 
3:00: Learning more about hooks in React as I will be passing lots of data between components
4:00: Applying for usage of several API keys that require you submit application information. I have designed my MVP to not depend on these, but would really love to have them and want to have as much time to receive a response as possible. 
4:30: Spent the remander of the day watching videos on using hooks as I think this will be one of the early challenges of reaching MVP

Timeline of Day Two 7/26
