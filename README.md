Epicodus Capstone

Timeline of Planning Day 7/19
8:30: Whiteboarding app design to break into components
9:00: White Board Splash Page components
9:30: Add single Trip compontent reduced down to only for MVP features
10:00: Building out component tree
10:30: Sketch out individual login and sign up design. Research into user authentication to see how component tree should be structured
11:00: Returning to whiteboarding to draw boxes around each component, deciding on component hierarchy 
11:30-onward: Researching mapping out React components, making sure my method is correct and watching tutorials on user authentication to see how login fits into component hierarchy
12:00: Moved to online diagraming of components as I ran out of room on paper/whiteboard. Researching and listing all resources to go into components so that I can create a realistic timeline of how long it will take to build my app and make sure my MVP is not to large.
